Nice to meet you! My name is Andrea Sala.
- I'm currently doing my Master Thesis in Physics (ML application to Medical Physics) at the Niguarda Hospital.
- I previously worked as an intern Data Scientist @ IQVIA - Integrated Analytics Team, where I worked on Knowledge Graph Embedding and Graph Neural Networks.

My repos include mostly university projects and other repos developed just for fun/experimenting new stuff
Unfortunately, the repo I'm working on at the moment is private, so it looks like I'm inactive 😂

Feel free to have a stroll around my profile 😙
Suggestions to improve my code quality / readability are always welcome!
